var T00 = "It's Her Birthday, Right? is a short film that I made for one of my foundation classes last year. It encapsulates the feeling of doing something over and over again and it not turning out the way you want it to. The film shows a girl attempting to make a birthday cake for her elderly neighbor. However, it keeps going wrong and she drops the freshly made cakes over and over."

var T01 = "One of my goals for this short film was to have a good variety of shots and angles in order to keep it interesting. I repeat a lot of the same actions every time I'm baking a new cake, so finding a way to keep it interesting to watch was crucial for me."

var T02 = "This was one of the many cakes I made for this film. Actually, I only made one cake and redecorated the same cake multiple times. I filmed myself dropping the cake, then after I picked it right back up and re-iced it for the next shot."

var T03 = "This image shows the cake dropped on the ground with the icing smeared into the concrete. This is one of my favorite images in the film. I like that the cake is still intact and in one piece, but it's completely upside and ruined anyways. I also just think that the way the icing looks on the ground is cool."
